    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2MlI3wW" target="blank">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> - learn how to uncover the
      hints and hidden details in a question, discover how to break down a problem into manageable chunks, develop
      techniques to unstick yourself when stuck, learn (or re-learn) core computer science concepts, and practice on 189
      interview questions and solutions.</li>
    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NPhvRX" target="blank">The Clean Coder</a> - this book is packed with practical
      advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique:
      It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work
      well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and
      understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act.</li>
    <li><a href='http://amzn.to/2BNciX2' target="blank">The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide</a> - early in
      his software developer career, John Sonmez discovered that technical knowledge alone isn't enough to break through
      to the next income level - developers need "soft skills" like the ability to learn new technologies just in time,
      communicate clearly with management and consulting clients, negotiate a fair hourly rate, and unite teammates and
      coworkers in working toward a common goal.</li>
    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/39O7hMm" target="blank">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> - Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt wrote
      the first edition of this influential book in 1999 to help their clients create better software and rediscover the
      joy of coding. Topics range from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for
      keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. </li>
